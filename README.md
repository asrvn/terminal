# Terminal

A tiny, fast [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) prompt with four segments: user@host, path, git HEAD, and a thin chevron. Colors come from a small [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) pastel palette.

<sub>(My setup pairs this theme with [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html) + [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) on Windows and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) + [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) on Linux)</sub>
